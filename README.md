# Damage Overlay
A mod for Minecraft (Java Edition 1.21.1 NeoForge)

Damage Overlay is a small mod that renders a red screen overlay based on the player's current health, making low health and incoming damage much more noticable to the player.

## Features

 - Renders a red vignette when health is low, becoming stronger as the health decreases further
 - Displays a short flash when taking damage, with higher damage resulting in a stronger flash
 - Highly configurable: Customize overall opacity, brightness, effect start health, and fade speeds
 - Overlays are hidden alongside the GUI when using the F1 key
